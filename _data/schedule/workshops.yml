        title: Containarized Development using Docker
        speaker: sanchit_balchandani
        description: >
          <p>Modern-day development has to be fast-paced. Docker and Container toolset helps
          us achieve this up to a certain extent. Especially when working in a large team
          environment and with too many microservices, it becomes very difficult to manage
          apps and there CI/CD, setup steps, etc. With Docker and Containers, we can solve
          the above-mentioned problem set.</p>

          <p>In this Workshop, attendees will get an intermediate level of introduction to
          Docker and Docker Compose with the help of some real-time use cases and demos.
          Sanchit will demonstrate and explain how Docker makes the developer more
          efficient. This would be a one and half hour workshop so we'd avoid discussing
          the very basics of Containers, Virtual Machines of Microservice, though we'll
          focus on to understand how to approach containerizing an application.</p>

        title: Computational Linear Algebra & Applications in Data Science
        speaker: Jaidev Deshpande
        description: >
          This workshop focuses on building a computational foundation for working with
          matrices within the Python ecosystem. It is a distillation of Gilbert Strang's
          MIT OCW course on Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing and Machine
          Learning. This will be an intermediate level workshop which introduces participants
          to applications of linear algebra in signal processing, statistics and machine
          learning. Participants will learn how to apply the scientific Python stack (NumPy,
          SciPy and sklearn) to these problems with real world examples.

        title: Kubernetes for dev - myth or reality ?
        speaker: arun_chaudhary
        description: >
          Myth- k8s is a relatively small bit of software you install on each box to
          make your own cloud; that’s what devs think but it’s not really true. It’s the
          time to decode k8s and devs need to be empowered. Time to become a cloud native
          dev and know what’s happening after code push ( infra magic :) )

        title: AI-Based chatbot building using open source bot-building framework
        speaker: yogesh_kothiya
        description: >
          Chatbots are the talk of the town, right? Businesses desperately need it because
          of its simplicity, scalability, automation and other obvious reasons. But truly
          AI-based, GDPR compliant, customizable and modular chatbot is hard to build?
          Not anymore with the python-based bot-building framework- rasa

        title: Build sophisticated REST api using Django Rest Framework
        speaker: Akshar Raaj
        description: >
          <p>We will extend Django polls tutorial to build an api layer for polls application.
          These apis could be consumed from a mobile or a web client.</p>

          <p>Audience will walk with a thorough understanding of building apis using DRF.
          Audience can expect to understand DRF concepts like APIView, ViewSet,
          ModelViewSet, Routers, Serializers, Authentication and Authorization.<p>

        description: >
          Complex topics can get complicated; they don’t have to be. Join us in this
          workshop to make some crazy scientific animations using Python. We will start
          from creating a circle and go till uncovering the simulation of fluid flow,
          making non-linear transformation, etc (each in under 20 lines of code)

        title: Unit Testing with Mocks
        speaker: Vijay Kumar
        description: >
          <p>The workshop is aimed at people who are familiar with Python basics, and would
          like to improve their skills, by learning how to write professional quality
          Python code.</p>

          <p>Modifying Python code without unit test cases is like walking through a field
          of landmines. Python's dynamic nature allows typos in variable / attribute names,
          and incorrect indentation to go unnoticed, until a specific input drives it
          through the erroneous code path. Integration testing be it manual or automated
          is insufficient and can at times be frustrating for Python code.</p>

          <p>Fortunately Python's ecosystem has a plethora of libraries that makes it easy
          to write unit test cases, by providing the needed infrastructure. Through this
          workshop we will show how to use the py.test framework for writing test cases.
          We will cover how dependencies can be isolated using mocking and patching.</p>

        title: Decrypting ML models using LIME
        speaker: laisha_wadhwa
        description: >
          With wide no. of libraries & frameworks available for building ML models, ML has
          become a black-box these days. Thus model interpretability is vital. But its hard
          to define a model's decision boundary in simple terms. With LIME its easy to produce
          faithful explanations and decrypt any ML model.
